# Changelog

Notable changes to Snow Watch. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.0] – 2026-11-10

The first release prepared as a product: no third-party login, safe to expose
publicly, and documented for anyone who wants to run it.

### Changed
- **Owner password instead of Cloudflare Access.** Forecasts are public and
  read-only; `OWNER_PASSWORD` unlocks Manage locations. `ADMIN_EMAILS`,
  `CF_ACCESS_TEAM`, `CF_ACCESS_AUDS` and `DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL` are gone. Upgrading
  from an Access setup: see [docs/deploy-notes-home.md](docs/deploy-notes-home.md).
- The scorecard compares the consensus with observations by calendar day, like
  the model rows (it used 06:00–06:00 windows before).
- The API container runs `uvicorn --factory snowwatch.api.app:production_app`
  with JSON logs; both containers run read-only.
- Plain-language wording throughout ("temperature-based depth", "high-resolution
  models").

### Added
- About page: data sources and licences, a forecast and avalanche disclaimer, a
  privacy note and the version. A friendly not-found page.
- "A new version is ready — Reload" instead of silent updates.
- `/api/meta` (version, commit, budgets and alert thresholds) and
  `/api/push/prefs`; the Alerts card now shows a device's saved choices.
- `snowwatch owner logout-all` and `snowwatch healthcheck worker`; the worker has
  a Docker health check.
- Nightly retention for forecast history, runs, jobs, flags and observations.
- Security headers (a strict Content-Security-Policy, HSTS in production),
  per-visitor rate limits, a tile-cache size cap (`TILES_MAX_MB`) and a
  push-subscription cap (`PUSH_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS`).
- Browser smoke tests, coverage, dependency audits and Dependabot in CI.
- MIT licence, security policy, contributing guide, deployment and architecture
  docs.

### Security
- MapLibre GL JS upgraded from 5.x to 6.17 for a critical sanitizer-bypass XSS
  advisory (GHSA-jrc7-96c5-q579).

### Fixed
- Push subscriptions could point anywhere, making the server send requests to
  any address; only browser push services are accepted now.
- Links from upstream data or old rows could be `javascript:` addresses.
- Quickly switching locations could show the previous location's data.
- A failed request read as "No avalanche zone" or "needs a snow station".
- A database error mid-run left the run "running" forever and skipped the
  remaining locations; interrupted runs and jobs are now closed at start-up.
- An empty upstream answer could wipe the ski-area list or avalanche zones; one
  bad avalanche product or radar image stopped the rest; a failed product fetch
  replaced the stored full forecast with a thin one.
- `Retry-After` was ignored, and an upstream outage could hold the worker for
  hours; a time budget now limits retries.
- Manage page actions failed silently; job polling continued after leaving.
- Dialogs didn't trap or restore focus; several inputs had no label.
- The owner's contact email was sent to every upstream service, not just NWS.

### Removed
- The prototype (`docs/reference/`, `sources/prototype.py`, the parity test).
- Unused components and the write-only `alerts` and `obs_hourly` tables.
